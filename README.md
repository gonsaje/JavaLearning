# JavaLearning

This repository is my structured practice environment for becoming a stronger, more interview-ready software engineer using **Java**.

## Objective

My main goals are to:

- Build a **solid Java foundation** from the ground up (OOP, core syntax, collections)
- Improve my ability to write **clean, correct, readable code**
- Become strong at **DSA / LeetCode** using Java as my primary language
- Develop the skills needed to be **Google / top-tier SWE interview ready**
- Practice consistent execution through a repeatable weekly schedule

## What I’m focusing on

### 1) Java Fundamentals

- Classes, objects, methods
- Encapsulation + access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
- Inheritance + polymorphism
- Early binding vs late binding
- Upcasting
- Writing simple, robust object-oriented code

### 2) Containers / Collections

- `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`
- `HashMap`, `HashSet`
- `Deque` (stack + queue patterns)
- Common iteration patterns and performance tradeoffs

### 3) Problem Solving (LeetCode)

This repo will include solutions and notes for:

- Arrays / Strings
- HashMap counting
- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Stacks / Queues
- Trees (later)

## Why I’m doing this

I want to stop relying on vague “I know Java” confidence and instead build real proof through:

- consistent reps
- clean implementations
- documented learning
- increasing difficulty over time

## Progress Tracking

I’ll be tracking:

- what I learned each day
- problems solved
- patterns I missed
- rewrites of solutions for speed + clarity

## Notes

This repo is intentionally focused on **fundamentals + repetition** over flashy projects.
The goal is mastery.
